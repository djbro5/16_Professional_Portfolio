                    I enrolled in the University of Adelaide Full Stack Web Coding Bootcamp so I could learn how to code the end-user device software for a specialised industrial IoT (Internet of Things) tracking product (patent pending) 
                    in development at AssistTech Innovation&trade;, a startup innovation technology company of which I am the owner. To begin, I conducted extensive market research to determine and validate the need together with market size.
                    I designed the prototype tracker system electronics, programmed in C the embedded controller for processinf edge data and developed a specialised LoRaWAN / GPS network system. I could employ a 
                    developer but was interested to learn full stack web development myself!<br><br>
                    My professional background is engineering (mechanical to biomedical) and graduate business studies (Innovation and Entrepreneurship).  Throughout my biomedical engineering career, I developed a CPAP
                    machine (form of positive airway pressure ventilator), designed and developed a multi-cell proportional counter for measuring genetic sequences, developed ISO 9001 Design and Development Quality Procedures, pioneered
                    AS/NZS 3551 electromedical equipment testing standards and in addition to many other projects, applied user-centred design methodology to design and develop a wheelchair mounted head controlled robotic arm.<br><br>
                    My biggest takeaway from the business studies, apart from accounting and finance, was marketing, and that it is a critical function of success, be it, personal success or business success. In 1998, I won two
                    Enterprise Workshop annual awards for Best Business plan and Best Marketing Plan for a real-life business venture. This was part of graduate studies at UniSA Graduate School of Business. Further recent studies
                    include Digital Marketing, Brand Positioning and Entrepreneurial Negotiation. Next step is a likely MBA.<br><br>
                    In addition to AsssistTech Innovation&trade;, I manage the business operation of Absolutely Fabulous Corporate&trade;, a successful corporate uniform fashion business that my wife started many years ago. We have contracts 
                    with several companies including a national airline and we proudly manufacture all uniforms in Australia. It is continuous innovation, total customer focus and, importantly, keeping up with economic, technological and societal 
                    trends that propels our company to sustainable growth and success.
